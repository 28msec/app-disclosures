    <h2>Financial Disclosure Research Utility</h2>

    <p>This application provides its user ability to research financial report policies, footnotes, and specific disclosures provided to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by public companies that are required to report to the SEC.</p>

    <p>These high quality financial disclosures can be used as examples by accountants when creating their own financial report disclosures.  These disclosures allow accountants to compare and contrast specific wording, what a disclosure contains, and other information for hundreds of disclosures.</p>

    <p>All information in this application comes from the XBRL-based financial filings provided by public companies to the SEC. Provided are the disclosures from the latest 10-K financial filing provided by the entity.</p>

    <p>Two versions of this application are available. The <b>basic version</b> allows its user to try the application and understand what the application does and does not provide. The <b>basic version</b> is limited to disclosures provided by the DOW 30 public companies. The <b>basic version</b> is free. It does not allow filtering and provides policies, footnotes, and specific disclosures reported in the financial statements of entities included in the DOW 30.</p>

    <p>The <b>plus version</b> of this application costs $9.95 per month or $120 per year. The <b>plus version</b> includes all public companies and an ability to filter entities by grouping (DOW 30, Fortune 100, S&P 500 are currently provided) and by Standard Industry Classification (SIC) code.</p>
